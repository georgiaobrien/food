                    <p>
                        Councils with Food Champions and Food Partnerships are better placed to fight food
                        poverty at a local level. Now, with the Food Justice Finder, you can search to find out whether
                        your local council has taken these crucial steps towards food justice.
                    </p>
                    <p> Based on newly collected FOI data and research covering England, Wales and Scotland, the Finder
                        spotlights and congratulates councils who have a Champion and Partnership, and helps members of
                        the public engage with councils who haven't yet taken both steps.
                    </p>
                    <p> Local councils are doing extraordinary work and fighting food poverty on multiple fronts, from
                        providing free school
                        meals to supporting food banks. This tool helps ensure that work is getting the publicity and
                        support from the local community that it needs and deserves. The burden of solving food poverty
                        shouldn't be falling on our overstretched communities and underfunded councils, but while it
                        does, we hope to help them battle food poverty is the most effective way possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>The coronavirus crisis and the extraordinary campaign by Marcus Rashford has brought the issue of
                        food poverty to the fore, but our communities were starving for food justice long before the
                        pandemic hit. This issue is not going away: with a second lockdown looming and Christmas just
                        weeks away, communities are preparing for the worst. You can help your council and your
                        community now by using the Food Justice Finder now, because for too many, finding food justice
                        has never been more important.</p>
                    <h2 class="high gw"><span>What is a Food Champion?</strong></span></h2>
                    <p>We know that for overstretched councils, it's easy for issues like food poverty to fall
                        between the cracks because responsibility for tackling it is split across different
                        councillors, teams or departments.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By appointing a "lead member" for food poverty, you create a Food Champion: a point
                        person who can draw together different work streams in a council, track progress and be
                        a single point of contact for helpful external organisations like community kitchens or
                        food banks.</p>
                    <h2 class="high gw"><span>What is a Food Partnership?</strong></span></h2>
                    <p>Food partnerships link up local government with local community organisations – so that
                        food banks, community kitchens and other amazing initiatives get all the support they
                        need.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Councils and communities are often independently doing amazing work to alleviate food
                        poverty in their area: but we know they're stronger when they work together. Existing
                        food partnerships, from Bangor to Brighton, have had a transformational effect on food
                        poverty in their areas.</p>
                    <h2 class="high gw"><span>Help for councillors</strong></span></h2>
                    <p>The Co-operative Party has produced a guide for Councillors to help them work towards the actions in their council, and read about best practice across the country. <a href="https://party.coop/publication/beyond-food-banks-campaigning-on-food-justice/">You can download the guide here.</a></p>
                    <h2 class="high gw"><span>Data</strong></span></h2>
                    <p>Our database is based on two sets of Freedom of Information (FOI) Requests sent to upper tier
                        councils in England in November 2018 and again in August 2020, asking whether they had a Lead
                        Member for food poverty and / or worked with a Food Partnership. If a council did not respond to
                        the 2020 FOI request, the 2018 data was used. Data on Scottish and Welsh councils was based on
                        publically available information and research. If you need to update the progress of your
                        council, then please email us at <a
